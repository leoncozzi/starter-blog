bio: I have been delivering IT Infrastructure for over two decades. My
  responsibilities have involved delivery and sales of technology across
  multiple domains. This has involved architecture, design, contractual
  development and negotiations. I am a regular speaker at conferences, and I am
  often asked to present to customers on many different technology and services
  concepts.  I love to constantly learn, as I am passionate about technology and
  how it can improve our life. My other passions are sailing, running and
  spending time with my wife and two daughters.
