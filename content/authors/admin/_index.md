# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I have been delivering IT Infrastructure for over two decades. My responsibilities have involved delivery and sales of technology across multiple domains. This has involved architecture, design, contractual development and negotiations. I am a regular speaker at conferences, and I am often asked to present to customers on many different technology and services concepts.

I love to constantly learn, as I am passionate about technology and how it can improve our life. My other passions are sailing, running and spending time with my wife and two daughters.
